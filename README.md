# BuzzStop
Scope:

As it stands, there is no App designed for a public transport passenger specifically buses, 
to successfully navigate the hundreds of stops on a single route. In an unfamiliar area with busy routes, 
steamed up windows and a bus packed with people, it’s not easy to see in advance where you need to get off. 
Without being able to easily see out the window where you are on a multi stop route, which stop is yours?

This App proposes to take the anxiety out of this form of public transport (especially tourists) by allowing users to 
input their destination and while travelling on the bus check where they are in relation to their destination and know 
when exactly to get off the bus.

Phase One Deliverables:

•	A responsive Website with specific emphasis on mobile devices
•	A login page with 3rd party login capabilities
•	A registration page with 3rd party login 
•	A home page that accepts destination input and displays a Map with current location and destination plus ETA. 
•	The ability to CHECK MY STOP, which updates the current location and gives a new ETA.
•	A search page that gives the user the ability to search destinations, recent places visited and friends locations 
•	An edit page to allow user information updates and destination updates.
Phase Two Deliverables:
•	The ability to message chosen friends with text and location services
•	The ability to search for and see some activity from friends (depending on their security settings)
Phase Three Deliverables:
•	The addition of notifications, 
•	The app will vibrate or alert the user one stop before they need to disembark (to help facilitate rush hour capacity, a user being upstairs on the bus, or any disabilities they may have which would hinder a quick departure). 
•	And then again when it’s their stop.
